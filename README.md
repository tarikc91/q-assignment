## Commands

## Task
Client
- Create a client for connection on Q Symfony Skeleton API (QSS)
- swagger documentation: https://symfony-skeleton.q-tests.com/docs
- credentials: email: ahsoka.tano@q.agency password: Kryze4President
- create a login page that uses Q Symfony Skeleton API, retrieve access token
- store the token using any storage you want (Session, Cookie, something more creative? (Up to you!), with any expiration time (use common sense, 10 seconds is a bad expiration time! :))

Authors
- fetch the list of Authors from the API, display them in a table layout
- enable a user to delete the author if there's no related books for this author
- Create a view page of single authors and their books
- Extra Bonus Part: Symfony CLI command to add a new author using the Q Symfony Skeleton API - this is just for extra points, if you have time ;-) It wonâ€™t make you look bad if you show excellent dev skills, but decide to skip this one

Books
- On single author view, enable the user to delete books (one by one)
- create a page where the user can add a new Book and select Authors from a dropdown menu

Profile
- after the user logs in - show his first and last name on the base page layout
- add logout link or button
